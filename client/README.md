This app is a wiki page of recipes. After you login, you can create and add a recipe to the recipe homepage where 
you can see everyone's recipes. You can also save recipes to your savedRecipes page. You also edit any recipe that you saved and change it for everyone just like a wiki page.

## Notes

1. I used Insomnia to test my Get,Put,Post,and Delete requests. But you can also use Postman.
2. I also used MongoDb to connect my app to a database. So make sure you do that as well.
